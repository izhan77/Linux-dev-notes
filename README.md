# 🐧 Linux Journey 2025 — Hands-On Learning Repo

This repository documents my **complete journey learning Linux and Unix system administration** for my **Spring 2025 semester**.  
Instead of just following theory, I’m focusing on *understanding, breaking, fixing,* and *mastering* each concept through the terminal (WSL + Ubuntu).

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build **strong Linux fundamentals** (not just memorize commands)
- Get **comfortable with Bash scripting & automation**
- Understand **users, permissions, processes, and scheduling**
- Learn **package management, system administration, and networking**
- Create a **mini project** to apply everything hands-on

## 🗓️ Weekly Plan (Aggressive + Practical)

| Week | Focus | Key Hands-on Tasks |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| **1** | Installation & Overview | Install Ubuntu/WSL, explore file system (`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`), learn man pages |
| **2** | Basic Commands | Practice file operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`), use redirection and pipes |
| **3** | More Commands | Learn `grep`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `head`, `tail`, and use pipelines efficiently |
| **4** | Users, Groups, Privileges | Create users/groups, switch users, manage `sudoers`, experiment with `chown`, `chmod` |
| **5** | Intro to Bash & Scripting | Write first scripts (`#!/bin/bash`), use variables, loops, conditions, arguments |
| **6** | Structures & Programs | Automate file operations, create scripts using `case`, `for`, and `while`, and functions |
| **7** | Admin Tasks | Learn system logs (`journalctl`, `/var/log`), scheduling with `cron`, monitoring with `top`, `htop` |
| **8** | Mid-term Exam | Revise everything using practical command challenges |
| **9** | Permissions & Shared Dirs | Deep dive `umask`, sticky bits, and collaborative directories |
| **10** | Processes & SJF Algorithm | Simulate SJF in Bash, learn `ps`, `kill`, `nice`, and `renice` |
| **11** | FCFS Algorithm | Implement FCFS scheduling in Bash or C, compare with SJF |
| **12** | Process Management & Scheduling | Learn `bg`, `fg`, `jobs`, `top`, `at`, and scheduling strategies |
| **13** | Packages in UNIX / CentOS | Master `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `snap`; install, remove, and update packages |
| **14** | Networking in CentOS | Learn IP config (`ip`, `ifconfig`), `ping`, `netstat`, `scp`, and SSH setup |
| **15** | Project Task I | Build a **system script** (like backup automation or user audit tool) using everything learned |

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
> I don’t memorize commands — I break things until I understand them.  
> Every command in this repo has been executed, tested, and sometimes failed (on purpose).

---

## 🧰 Tools
- **WSL (Ubuntu 22.04)**  
- **Visual Studio Code**  
- **Git & GitHub for version control**  
- **Optional:** VirtualBox + CentOS for system-level testing
